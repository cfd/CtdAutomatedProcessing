CtdAutomatedProcessing
======================

The CTD Automated Processing System (CAPS) is a java program that parses various .xmlcon files into a format that is more efficient and readable. 
The properties of the sensors for each instrument are shown. The program outputs six .psa files for a .xmlcon file which will contain various data. 
It is also backwards compatiable with some .con files, provided they have the right information in them. The CAPS program sorts all files and runs 
the Seabird software automatically allowing the required 'final' files to be created with just one execution of the batch file process.
