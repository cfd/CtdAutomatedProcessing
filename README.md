CtdAutomatedProcessing
======================

The CTD Automated Processing System (CAPS) is a program that parses various .xmlcon files into a format that is more efficient and readable. 
The properties of the sensors for each instrument are shown. The program will output six .psa files for each .xmlcon file which will contain 
various data used for the greater purpose of those who actually care :P.
