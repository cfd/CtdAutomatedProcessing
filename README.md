CtdAutomatedProcessing
======================

The CTD Automated Processing System (CAPS) is a java program that parses various .xmlcon files into a format that is more efficient and readable. The properties of the sensors for each instrument are shown. The program outputs six .psa files for a .xmlcon file which will contain various data. It is also backwards compatiable with some .con files, provided they have the right information in them.
